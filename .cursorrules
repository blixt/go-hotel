Write elegant code but not too clever.
Always consider performance, avoid unnecessary copies or loops.
But don't optimize to the point of making the code harder to understand.
For JavaScript specifically:
- Always prefer for ... of instead of forEach.
- The JavaScript in this codebase does not run through any bundler or compiler, it is pure ESM run in the browser with an import map for the bare module imports.
- Use JSDoc to declare TypeScript types to keep the code as strongly typed as possible.
